How did you determine number of clusters?

You answer:

“I used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate model complexity and fit.”

How does clustering improve energy efficiency?

You answer:

“We identify traffic density clusters and allocate energy resources dynamically based on cluster intensity, reducing unnecessary power usage during low-demand periods.”
